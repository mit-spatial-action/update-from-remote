# update-from-remote
Lil' utility that pulls the last modified date of a remote file and checks it against previously logged downloads in order to determine whether there has been an update on the remote. If the remote has been updated, it downloads the updated file, pushes it to Dropbox, and moves the outdated local copy to an archive folder.
